Finger-guided maze:
- Use pixel color detection; from there itâ€™s as straightforward as pre-drawing mazes or making some way to generate them on a grid system

Physical ball maze:
- Rotate the phone to let the ball roll through the maze

Call Out:
- Words are pulled from a dictionary and have letters pulled to create blanks.  The user has to call out words, trying to guess what the words are.
